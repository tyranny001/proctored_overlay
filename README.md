# OverlayHUD (LayerX by Ravi)

OverlayHUD is a specialized **stealth productivity overlay** designed to bridge your digital screen environment with advanced AI reasoning. It allows you to capture **any visible text on your screen** (even in restricted environments) and receive **instant solutions** from world-class AI models.

---

## 🚀 Overview & Intent

OverlayHUD is built for seamless integration between your active screen and advanced AI logic.

**Primary goal:**
- Solve complex problems *directly from the screen*
- No copy-paste
- No window switching
- No manual data entry

---

## 🧩 Bypassing Protections

OverlayHUD uses **low-level Windows API techniques** to operate discreetly in controlled environments:

### 🔹 Stealth Display
- Uses specific **Window Display Affinity** flags
- Invisible to standard screen recorders and screen-sharing software

### 🔹 Protected Environments
- Functions on some platforms that monitor:
  - Active windows
  - Screenshot attempts
  - Overlay detection

### 🔹 Input Layering
- Transparent overlay layer
- Does **not** steal mouse or keyboard focus
- Underlying applications remain fully interactive

---

## 🛡️ Security Disclaimer

### ✅ What It Can Bypass
- Standard screen recording software
- Common screenshot tools
- Basic proctoring overlays

### ❌ What It Cannot Bypass
- Kernel-level recorders
- Driver-based anti-cheat systems
- Hardware-level capture mechanisms

> **Note:** OverlayHUD does not attempt kernel-level evasion.
